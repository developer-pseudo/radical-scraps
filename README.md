# Radical Scraps

Radical Scraps is a modpack where you examine structures, collect scrap from them and automate stuff.
The early game of the pack is hard, since you have no tech crafting options **and** mobs + structures have tech.

## Issues

Once this pack is released on CurseForge I would appreciate it if **YOU** report any issues with it!!
